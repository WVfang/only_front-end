		<p id="text">Im my personal opinion, picking up the syntax of Less is the easy part - expecially since it feels like a natural extension of CSS. I belive the biggest hurdle for developers with Less is the compiling compenent. Between people using different local/server environments, being scared of the command line, or just the hurdle caused by learning a task-runner, integrating Less or any preprocessor can be quite troublesome without some guidance</p>
